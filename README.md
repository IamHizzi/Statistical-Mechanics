# Statistical-Mechanics
Illustrating various topics in classical and quantum statistical mechanics through Monte Carlo sampling methods.

Physical and mathematical subjects that are addressed include:
* Direct and Markov-chain Monte Carlo methods
* Equivalence of Newton and Boltzmann mechanics
* Entropic interactions and liquid gas phase transitions
* Monte Carlo integration
* Quantum statistical mechanics: path integral representation of the density matrix
* Bose-Einstein condensation
* The Ising model of ferromagnetism

The material presented here closely follows "Statistical Mechanics: Algorithms and Computations" by W. Krauth' from the École normale supérieure and "Statistical Mechanics: A Set of Lectures" by R. P. Feynman.
